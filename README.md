# Query 1

I want you to play a multiplayer version of the pen and paper game racetrack. It should be one index.html file, one script.js file and one style.css file.
I want this to be a multiplayer game with two stages: Stage 1 allows someone to draw a curve and then that curve is widened to form the race track with the start and end point chosen randomly. Stage 2 is the actual game. We add an arbitrary number of players with their names and they take turn. The race car can move according to the standard rules. I want this to behave like how in chess when I click on a pawn I get to see the fields I can move to. Draw a vector from the current position to the center square and highlight the surrounding squares in the players color. If a player leaves the track they are being moved two moves. Winner is who finishes the track first.
This should be playable by kids so keep a simple style present.
Also provide an option to print the track (with or without grid lines).

# Query 2

Okay, not such a childish style. Just simplify it so it looks modern. also make the track creation larger and simplify everything a bit, buttons at the top, etc. there is an issue so as is visible by this image: after creating the track, clear any edges that are inside the course. See the picture.
